          <ul>  <li>J. Robert Oppenheimer, in full Julius Robert Oppenheimer, (born April 22, 1904, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 18, 1967, Princeton, New Jersey)</li>
           <li>The oretical physicist and science administrator, noted as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory (1943-45) during development of the atomic bomb and as director of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1947-66). </li>
             <li>   Accusations of disloyalty led to a government hearing that resulted in the loss of his security clearance and of his position as adviser to the highest echelons of the U.S. government. </li>
           <li> The case became a cause célèbre in the world of science because of its implications concerning political and moral issues relating to the role of scientists in government.

   <ol> <li>After being accepted into Christ's College, Cambridge in 1924, Oppenheimer wrote to Ernest Rutherford requesting permission to work at the Cavendish Laboratory, 
    though Bridgman's letter of recommendation said that Oppenheimer's clumsiness in the laboratory suggested that theoretical physics, rather than experimental, would be his forte.</li>
    <li>Rutherford was unimpressed, but Oppenheimer went to Cambridge nonetheless; he was ultimately accepted by J. J. 
     Thomson on the condition that he complete a basic laboratory course.</li>
    <li>
        Oppenheimer was very unhappy at Cambridge and wrote to a friend: <u>
           <b> "I am having a pretty bad time. The lab work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that I am learning anything" </b></u>.
         He developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor, Patrick Blackett.
    </li>
    <li>According to Oppenheimer's friend Francis Fergusson, Oppenheimer once confessed to leaving an apple doused with noxious chemicals on Blackett's desk. </li>
    <li>the university authorities not to press criminal charges or expel him,
         but Oppenheimer was placed on probation and had to have regular sessions with a psychiatrist in Harley Street, London.</li>
